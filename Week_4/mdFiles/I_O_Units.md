There are many input/output devices like keyboard, mouse, scanner, monitor, printer, microphone, video camera etc. The functions of these devices are different from each other. The data transfer rate of different input/output devices is different. They also support different data formats. It is not posiible to connect all these devices directly to the system bus. similarly, it is also difficult for CPU to control these devices. A specaial hardware component known as I/O unit is used to solve these problems.

I/O unit is very important component of computer. It is used to control different I.O Devices such as keyboard,monitor,printer,disk drives etc.

I/O units can perform all I/O operations without the involvement of CPU. I/O units also responsible to manage the speed difference between processor and I/O devices.

There are two ways to transfer data between I/O devices and main memory.
